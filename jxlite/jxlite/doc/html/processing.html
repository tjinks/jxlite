	<h1>Processing</h1> 
	<p>
	This section provides an overview of the way in which JxLite processes an XML document. 
	<h2>Basic Processing Rules</h2>
	<p>
	When an interface method which has a @Path annotation is called, the value that is returned depends on three things:
	<ul>
		<li>The XPath specified by the @Path annotation
		<li>The method's return type
		<li>The implicit current XPath context (always be an XML Element)
	</ul>
	<p>
	JxLite's initial XPath context is set from the argument passed to the <em>unmarshal</em> method. This can  
	be either an <span class="inlcode">org.w3c.dom.Element</span> or an 
	<span class="inlcode">org.w3c.dom.Document</span> (in the second case the context becomes the document's root element). 
	Any relative XPath expressions are taken to be relative to this context. So, returning to the <em>Person</em> interface 
	from the introduction:
	<div class="code">	
public interface Person {
    @Path("forename")
    String getForename();

    @Path("surname")
    String getSurname();

    @Path("@age")
    int getAge();
}
	</div> 
	<p>
	The first path annotation says that the return value of the <em>getForename</em>
	method is obtained from an element named 'forename' immediately below
	the current XPath context element. The return type is String, so
	JxLite simply takes the text content of this element and returns it.
	If there is no such element then JxLite returns <span class="inlcode">null</span>. (If there is more
	than one forename element then JxLite will throw an exception - more on this later).
	<p>
	Processing of the <em>getSurname</em> method is essentially identical.
	<p>
	The path annotation for the <em>getAge</em> method specifies that the return value is obtained from an attribute on the 
	current context element named 'age'. The return value is of type <span class="inlcode">int</span>, 
	so the text value of this attribute 
	is obtained and
	converted to an integer. If the conversion fails then JxLite throws an exception. JxLite also throws an exception if
	the attribute is not present. (This is because we can't return <span class="inlcode">null</span> in this case. 
	If the attribute was optional we would need to redeclare the return type to be <span class="inlcode">java.lang.Integer</span> 
	rather than the primitive type <span class="inlcode">int</span>). 
	<p>
	JxLite has built-in rules for converting the value of an XML node to any of the following Java data types:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="inlcode">java.lang.String</span> 
		<li><span class="inlcode">int</span> 
		<li><span class="inlcode">java.lang.Integer</span> 
		<li><span class="inlcode">boolean</span> 
		<li><span class="inlcode">java.lang.Boolean</span>
		<li><span class="inlcode">char</span>
		<li><span class="inlcode">java.lang.Character</span>
		<li><span class="inlcode">double</span>
		<li><span class="inlcode">java.lang.Double</span>
		<li><span class="inlcode">java.util.Date</span>
		<li><span class="inlcode">java.util.Calendar</span>
	</ul>
	<p> 
	(The last two expect the input to be a full a XML date/time with an optional timezone - e.g. 
	<span class="inlcode">2014-04-25T18:31:04Z</span>)  
	<p>
	Additionally, a method can be declared to return a List, Collection, Iterable or array
	of the above types, in which case the XPath expression may return multiple nodes. Each node is 
	converted to the appropriate Java type 
	as above, and the resulting (zero or more) values are placed in the returned collection.
	<h2>Conversions from XML to Java Types</h2>
	<p>
	The following table describes how XML nodes are converted to instances of the Java types listed above. 'Trim' indicates
	whether or not leading and trailing whitespace characters are removed before attempting the conversion. If the conversion
	cannot be performed as described then a JxLiteClientException is thrown. 
	</p>
	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<th>Target Type</th>
			<th>Conversion Rules</th>
			<th>Trim</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>int<br>java.lang.Integer</td>
			<td>The text content of the XML node is converted to
			an integer. If the result is outside the valid range
			for a Java int, then a JxLiteClientException is thrown.</td>
			<td>Y</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>double<br>java.lang.Double</td>
			<td>The text content of the XML node is converted to
			a double.</td>
			<td>Y</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>boolean<br>java.lang.Boolean</td>
			<td>The text content of the XML node, which must be one of
			'yes', 'no', 'true' or 'false' is converted to a boolean value. </td>
			<td>Y</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>char<br>java.lang.Character</td>
			<td>The text content of the XML node, which must be a single character,
			is returned. </td>
			<td>N</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>java.lang.String</td>
			<td>The text content of the XML node is returned.</td>
			<td>N</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>java.lang.Calendar<br>java.lang.Date</td>
			<td>The text content of the XML node, which must be formatted as an xs:dateTime 
			(e.g. <span class="inlcode">2014-04-27T20:06:44+01:00</span>),
			is parsed into the specified Java type.</td>
			<td>Y</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>org.w3c.dom.Node</td>
			<td>The input XML node is simply returned. (This might be useful if you need to parse
			part of an XML document but pass the rest on unchanged for further processing).</td>
			<td>N/A</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<h2>Processing XML Trees</h2>
	<p>
	Of course most XML is more complex than this. Suppose the <em>person</em> XML
	format is enhanced to include an address:
	<div class="code">
&lt;person age="21"&gt;
    &lt;forename&gt;Fred&lt;/forename&gt; 
    &lt;surname&gt;Bloggs&lt;/surname&gt; 
    &lt;address&gt;
      &lt;line1&gt;3 The Avenue&lt;/line&gt;
      &lt;line2&gt;Oxwood&lt;/line&gt;
      &lt;postcode&gt;XW1 1XW&lt;/postcode&gt;
    &lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
	</div>
	<p>
	One option - which might be appropriate here - would be to modify the <span class="inlcode">Person</span> interface 
	to include the additional address data directly:
	<div class="code">
public interface PersonWithAddress1 {
    @Path("forename")
    String getForename();

    @Path("surname")
    String getSurname();

    @Path("@age")
    int getAge();
    
    @Path("address/line1")
    String getAddressLine1();
    
    @Path("address/line2")
    String getAddressLine2();
    
    @Path("address/postcode")
    String getPostcode();
}
	</div>
	<p>
	However for more deeply nested XML structures, 
	or those containing arbitrarily repeated elements, this would
	quickly become impractical. What we would like is to create a tree of Java objects that closely matches the
	XML structure. JxLite supports this by allowing the return type of an interface method to be another interface that can itself
	be unmarshalled by JxLite. So we can define a new interface <span class="inlcode">Address</span> and modify 
	<span class="inlcode">Person</span> to have a method which returns an instance of this interface:
	<div class="code">
public interface Address {
    @Path("line1")
    String getLine1();

    @Path("line2")
    String getLine2();
	
    @Path("postcode")
    String getPostcode();
}
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="code">
public interface PersonWithAddress2 {
    @Path("forename")
    String getForename();

    @Path("surname")
    String getSurname();

    @Path("@age")
    int getAge();
    
    @Path("address")
    Address getAddress();
}
	</div>
	<p>
	When the <span class="inlcode">getAddress</span> method is invoked, JxLite changes the current XPath context to be
	the document's address element and then unmarshals the contents of this element into an <span class="inlcode">Address</span> instance.
	This ensures that the XPaths specified in the <span class="inlcode">Address</span> interface are interpreted
	correctly (and not as being relative to the original person element).
	<h2>Processing Collections</h2>	
	<p>
	As mentioned above, JxLite can handle XPaths that return multiple nodes. JxLite is alerted to the 
	fact that an XPath expression may return multiple nodes by declaring the associated method to return an
	array, <span class="inlcode">java.util.List</span>, 
	<span class="inlcode">java.util.Collection</span> or
	<span class="inlcode">java.lang.Iterable</span>. As an example let's change the XML address format above to allow mutliple
	address lines (rather than just two):
	<div class="code">
&lt;address&gt;
    &lt;lines&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;Flat 5&lt;/line&gt;	
        &lt;line&gt;3 The Avenue&lt;/line&gt;	
        &lt;line&gt;Wittering&lt;/line&gt;	
        &lt;line&gt;Oxwood&lt;/line&gt;
    &lt;/lines&gt;
    &lt;postcode&gt;XW1 1XW&lt;/postcode&gt;
&lt;address&gt;	
	</div>
	<p>
	We can declare a matching Java interface as follows:
	<div class="code">
public interface MultiLineAddress {
    @Path("lines/line")
    String[] getAddressLines();
	
    @Path("postcode")
    String getPostcode();
}
	</div>
	<p>
	A call to <span class="inlcode">getAddressLines</span> will now return an array of strings, containing the address lines in the 
	same order in which they appear in the XML document. 
	<h2>Caching</h2>
	<p>
	When you call the <span class="inlcode">Unmarshaller.unmarshal</span> method, JxLite actually reads the entire XML document
	(or the portion below the element passed to <span class="inlcode">unmarshal</span>), extracts the return value for
	each interface method and caches these values. Therefore if you call the same interface method twice you will get the same
	Java object back each time. An important consequence is that you shouldn't modify the returned objects. E.g. going back to the
	<span class="inlcode">People</span> class from the introduction:
	<div class="code">
	People people = unmarshaller.unmarshal(doc);
	List&lt;Person&gt; allPeople = people.getPeople();
	allPeople.clear();
	allPeople = people.getPeople(); // Returns an empty list!
	</div>
